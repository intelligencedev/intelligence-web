  Serve the static file at static/index.html as the site's homepage.
  This template reads the file from the project root's "static" directory
  and writes its contents verbatim to the generated homepage. We use safeHTML
  to avoid escaping the HTML content. If you prefer Hugo to manage the page via
  templates/content files, replace this with a normal template.
